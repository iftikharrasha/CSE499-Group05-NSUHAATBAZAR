**HaatBazar** used to be a day-long business and entrepreneurship simulation and one of the most popular event organized by the Career & Placement Centre of North South University. For the fourth time, it was successfully held in 2014 and it was last. The goal of the event was for the students enrolled in the entrepreneurship course to gain exposure to being a real-life entrepreneur for a day. The event did play a significant role in encouraging young entrepreneurs but don't know why it never happened again. Our objective is to recreate the legacy of NSU Haatbazar in a digital platform.
